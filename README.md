#Angular 2 Dependency Injection (DI) Explained

## About this repo
This repo contains the example code for the Eggheadio Angular 2 Dependency Injection course. This code has a few modifications from the original series to stay up-to-date with Angular 2 best practices. Each lesson is in it's own branch with the code relevant to that lesson. In each branch there is a link to a plunk where the code is ran. If the repo is downloaded locally just run `npm install` and `ng serve`.

## Course Description
This course will teach you the ins and outs of dependency injection in Angular 2. You will learn what dependency injection means, how it applies to software in general and how it is implemented in Angular 2. We will take a look at simple use cases like injecting services, to exploring different providers recipes and when they are useful. We will also cover almost unknown features like viewProviders, OpaqueToken and edge cases where forwardRef() is needed.
